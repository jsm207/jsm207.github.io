        <article>
          <p>
            In my first 5 semesters studying software engineering at the University
            of Miami, I have found myself exactly where I need to be. As I delve deeper into the
            real world applications of the knowledge I acquire with each day,
            I cannot help but be thrilled at the endless possibilities provided
            by this uniquely important skillset. While I have learned and coded in several languages
            including C, C++, C# and java, this portfolio will specifically showcase programs written
            in C and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            Down the road whether I'm working for a company or attempting to navigate
            the world of innovative technology as a freelance programmer, I eventually hope to use my knowledge to positively impact the world
            in any way I can, by finding new ways to connect people and make their
            lives just a little bit easier.

      <h3>Code Functionality</h3>
      <article>
        <p>These five C programs are necessary to execute the parallel process shown in the diagram below.
          The process serves the purpose of sorting very large data sets in parallel with a concurrency level
          of 2, using parent-child processes to streamline efficiency. The data read into and written out of
          each child process travels by way of filestream piping, directly into executed programs included in the
          children.

        <h4>Individual Programs</h4>
        <p>The program "myCat2.c" reads data from files, outputting all or a subset of the source data. "mySort2.c" then sorts the
          specified subset written out from myCat2.c, while "myFormat2.c" will prepend a specific code, either 1 or 2, to specify
          which data set the string is from. "myMerge2.c" will then separate the strings based on their prepended codes, merge the data,
          and finally write the data to stdout. "myParent3.c" is the parent-child process including all of the code necessary to
          ensure that the parallel process perform as expected. This is the program of interest, and thus as been included in a gist below.
